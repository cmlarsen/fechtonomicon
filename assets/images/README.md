# Assets - Images

## Required Image

**floral-pattern.png** - Gothic floral damask pattern for background
- Save your uploaded pattern as `floral-pattern.png` in this directory
- Will be displayed as a repeating tile at 8% opacity with a vignette overlay
- The pattern will tile seamlessly across the entire app background

## Adding the Image

1. Save your pattern image to this directory:
   ```
   /Users/caleb/Documents/__Hobbies___/hema-flash-cards-app/assets/images/floral-pattern.png
   ```

2. The app will automatically pick it up and display it as a repeating background

**Note**: The image should ideally be a seamless tile pattern (around 256x256 to 512x512 pixels) for best results.
